    "description": "NOA is Cluj's flagship big-room experience—an elevated, glossy box of light and sound where commercial house, EDM and pop remixes surge through a packed main floor. The booth is high and centered; strobes chase across a sea of hands while CO₂ bursts kiss the drop. It's an upscale scene with Transylvanian edge: students, creators, visiting artists and tech teams out celebrating wins. Expect VIP islands and quick bottle service, plus a bar that moves efficiently on classics. The programming swings from resident crowd-pleasers to costumed theme nights; when the room hits its stride around 1am, it feels like a small festival indoors. Security is courteous but firm (ID, dress code). If you want Euro-club theatrics without losing the friendly Cluj vibe, this is the sweet spot—slick, social, and designed for a sunrise exit.",
