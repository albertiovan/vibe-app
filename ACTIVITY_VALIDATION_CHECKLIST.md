# ‚úÖ Activity Validation Checklist

**Use this BEFORE importing ChatGPT-generated activities to ensure semantic quality**

---

## üéØ Quick Validation (30 seconds per activity)

For EACH activity, check these 7 items:

### 1. ‚úÖ Description is SEMANTIC-RICH

**Ask:** Does it explain the EXPERIENCE, not just what it is?

‚ùå **FAIL:** "Pottery class where you make bowls on a wheel"
‚úÖ **PASS:** "Center clay on a spinning wheel, pull walls upward with wet hands, shape a bowl through patient technique. Leave with something you built - that proud feeling of physical creation."

**Semantic elements to look for:**
- [ ] Physical actions (what you DO with hands/body)
- [ ] Emotional outcome (how you FEEL)
- [ ] Tangible results (what you GET/make)
- [ ] Process nature (step-by-step vs freeform)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Energy Level is HONEST

**Common mistakes:**

‚ùå Pottery = "low" (WRONG! Requires focus + arm strength)
‚úÖ Pottery = "medium" (CORRECT)

‚ùå Gentle yoga = "medium" (WRONG! It's stretching)
‚úÖ Gentle yoga = "low" (CORRECT)

‚ùå CrossFit = "medium" (WRONG! It's intense!)
‚úÖ CrossFit = "high" (CORRECT)

**Energy Guidelines:**
- **low** (0-3 METs): Spa, massage, meditation, gentle walks, reading
- **medium** (3-6 METs): Pottery, painting, casual cycling, badminton, yoga
- **high** (6+ METs): CrossFit, running, climbing, intense sports, HIIT

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Mood Tags MATCH the Feeling

**Ask:** What FEELING does this activity create?

Building/crafting activities should have:
- ‚úÖ `creative` (always)
- ‚úÖ `mindful` or `focused` (concentration)
- ‚úÖ `cozy` or `explorer` (depending on vibe)

Sports activities should have:
- ‚úÖ `adrenaline` (if competitive/intense)
- ‚úÖ `social` (if team/group)
- ‚úÖ `adventurous` (if challenging/new)

Wellness activities should have:
- ‚úÖ `relaxed` (always)
- ‚úÖ `cozy` or `mindful` (calm feeling)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ All Required Tags Present

**Must have:**
- [ ] `tags_experience_level` (beginner/intermediate/advanced/mixed)
- [ ] `tags_mood` (at least 2-3 moods)
- [ ] `tags_context` (solo/date/friends/family/group)
- [ ] `tags_equipment` (provided/rental-gear/none)
- [ ] `tags_requirement` (booking-required/optional)
- [ ] `tags_cost_band` ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)

**If outdoor, must also have:**
- [ ] `tags_terrain` (urban/forest/mountain/coast/lake)
- [ ] `tags_weather_fit` (all_weather/ok_in_rain/wind_sensitive)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Tag Format is CORRECT

**Common mistakes:**

‚ùå `"creative, mindful, cozy"` (spaces after commas!)
‚úÖ `"creative,mindful,cozy"` (no spaces!)

‚ùå `"solo date friends"` (missing commas!)
‚úÖ `"solo,date,friends"` (commas between!)

‚ùå `"context:solo,context:date"` (prefixes in CSV!)
‚úÖ `"solo,date"` (no prefixes - import adds them!)

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Indoor/Outdoor is ACCURATE

**Common mistakes:**

‚ùå Pottery = "outdoor" (NO! Studios are indoors)
‚úÖ Pottery = "indoor"

‚ùå Park walk = "indoor" (NO!)
‚úÖ Park walk = "outdoor"

‚ùå Yoga = "indoor" (MAYBE! Can be outdoor too)
‚úÖ Yoga = "both" (can do inside or outside)

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Duration is REALISTIC

**Common mistakes:**

‚ùå Pottery workshop = 30 min (TOO SHORT!)
‚úÖ Pottery workshop = 120-180 min

‚ùå CrossFit class = 180 min (TOO LONG!)
‚úÖ CrossFit class = 60-90 min

‚ùå Coffee break = 120 min (TOO LONG!)
‚úÖ Coffee break = 15-30 min

**Guidelines:**
- Quick resets: 15-30 min
- Classes: 60-120 min
- Workshops: 120-240 min
- Full-day: 240-480 min

## üìã Batch Validation Script

For validating multiple activities at once:

```bash
# Count activities
wc -l activities_new.csv

# Check for spaces after commas (BAD!)
grep -n ', ' activities_new.csv

# Check all have required columns
head -1 activities_new.csv | tr ',' '\n' | nl

# Verify energy levels
cut -d',' -f14 activities_new.csv | sort | uniq -c

# Verify categories
cut -d',' -f3 activities_new.csv | sort | uniq -c
```

## üö® Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Add semantic richness to description

Before:
```
"Pottery class where you make a bowl on the wheel"
```

After:
```
"Center wet clay on a spinning wheel, pull walls upward with steady hands, shape a bowl through patient technique. Leave with something tangible you built from scratch - that proud feeling of physical creation."
```

### Fix 2: Correct energy level

Before:
```csv
pottery-class,Pottery Wheel,creative,...,low,beginner,...
```

After:
```csv
pottery-class,Pottery Wheel,creative,...,medium,beginner,...
```

### Fix 3: Remove spaces from tags

Before:
```csv
...,beginner,"creative, mindful, cozy","urban",provided,"solo, small-group",...
```

After:
```csv
...,beginner,"creative,mindful,cozy","urban",provided,"solo,small-group",...
```

### Fix 4: Add missing mood tags

Before:
```csv
...,medium,beginner,"","urban",provided,...
```

After:
```csv
...,medium,beginner,"creative,mindful,focused","urban",provided,...
```

## üöÄ Ready to Import

Once validated:

```bash
cd backend
npx tsx scripts/import-activities-batch[N].ts
```

Check logs for:
```
‚úÖ Imported: Activity Name (category)
‚úÖ Found 20 semantically matched activities
```

Test with semantic analyzer:
```
User: "I miss legos"
Should match: ‚úÖ Your woodworking/pottery/jewelry activities
Should NOT match: ‚ùå Sports or spa activities
```

## üìä Post-Import Verification

Test these vibes in Training Mode:

1. "I miss legos" ‚Üí Should get your new building/creating activities
2. "I want sports" ‚Üí Should get sports/fitness (not new crafts)
3. "I'm exhausted" ‚Üí Should get wellness (not high-energy sports)

If semantic matching works correctly, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ 80%+ approval for activities that match vibe
- ‚úÖ Category accuracy 95%+
- ‚úÖ Energy level matches 90%+

**Your activities are now optimized for intelligent semantic matching!** üéØ
