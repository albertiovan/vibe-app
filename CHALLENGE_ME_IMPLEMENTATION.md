# Challenge Me Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview

**Challenge Me** is a personalized feature that analyzes each user's activity patterns and suggests 3 NEW, EXCITING challenges that push them outside their comfort zone. It's designed to encourage exploration and help users discover activities they wouldn't normally choose.

## Key Features

### ✅ User-Specific Learning
- Analyzes past 90 days of user activity from conversation history
- Tracks accepted challenges with higher weight (2x)
- Identifies dominant categories, energy levels, and preferences

### ✅ Smart Challenge Generation
1. **Local Challenge** - Different category in user's city
2. **Travel Challenge** - Adventurous activity outside city (Brașov, Sinaia, etc.)
3. **Extreme Challenge** - Completely opposite of user's pattern + adrenaline

### ✅ Intelligent Matching Logic

**If user usually does:**
- Creative/Learning → Suggests Sports/Adventure/Fitness
- Wellness/Mindfulness → Suggests Sports/Adventure
- Nightlife → Suggests Nature/Mindfulness/Wellness
- Indoor → Suggests Outdoor activities
- Low energy → Suggests High energy

### ✅ Accept/Decline Workflow
- User sees 3 challenge cards (horizontal scroll)
- Each card shows: Name, Category, Energy, Location, Reason, Venue
- **Accept** → Beautiful "Challenge Accepted!" animation + saves to user_challenges
- **Decline** → Records for learning + removes from list

### ✅ Beautiful UI
- Gradient cards with category-specific colors
- Challenge badges (#1, #2, #3)
- Energy and location indicators
- Smooth animations on accept
- Full-screen celebration overlay

## Challenge Selection Logic

### Step 1: Analyze User Pattern
```typescript
// From past 90 days
dominantCategories: ["creative", "learning"]
dominantEnergy: "low"
activityCount: 25
```

### Step 2: Determine Opposite Categories
```typescript
creative → ["sports", "adventure", "fitness"]
learning → ["nature", "adventure", "mindfulness"]
// Opposites: ["sports", "adventure", "fitness", "nature", "mindfulness"]
```

### Step 3: Query Database
**Local Challenge:**
- Category: One of opposites
- Energy: Opposite of user's (low → high)
- Region: Same as user (București)
- Exclude: Already seen activities

**Travel Challenge:**
- Category: adventure, nature, sports, water
- Energy: high (always exciting)
- Region: Brașov, Prahova, Sinaia, Constanța
- Exclude: User's city + already seen

**Extreme Challenge:**
- Category: NOT in user's dominant list
- Energy: Different from user's pattern
- Tags: Must have 'mood:adrenaline'
- Exclude: Already seen

### Step 4: Fetch Venues
- Get top 3 venues for each challenge activity
- Include venue name, city, rating
- Provides concrete places to visit

## Challenge Reasons

Auto-generated based on category mismatch:

| Challenge Category | User Pattern | Generated Reason |
