## üéØ MASTER PROMPT FOR CHATGPT

```
You are helping me curate activities for an intelligent recommendation system that uses SEMANTIC VIBE UNDERSTANDING, not just keyword matching.

CRITICAL: Our AI deeply analyzes user intent, emotion, and underlying needs. For example:
- "I miss legos" ‚Üí AI understands: building, creating, tactile making, pride in finishing physical objects
- "I want sports" ‚Üí AI understands: physical exertion, competition, achievement, possibly social

YOUR TASK: Generate activities that are SEMANTICALLY RICH and properly tagged.

---

## ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. DESCRIPTION (Most Important!)
Write descriptions that reveal the UNDERLYING EXPERIENCE, not just what it is.

‚ùå BAD: "Pottery class where you make bowls"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Shape clay with your hands in a step-by-step process, learning wedging, centering, and pulling techniques. Leave with a tangible object you built from scratch - that satisfying feeling of creating something physical."

Include these semantic elements:
- WHAT YOU DO with your hands/body (tactile, physical details)
- HOW IT FEELS emotionally (proud, calm, excited, accomplished)
- WHAT YOU GET from it (tangible object, skill, experience, social connection)
- STEP-BY-STEP vs FREEFORM nature
- SOLO vs SOCIAL experience

### 2. CATEGORY (Required)
Choose ONE primary category:
- creative, sports, fitness, adventure, wellness, mindfulness, nature, culinary, culture, learning, water, social, romance, seasonal, nightlife

### 3. ENERGY LEVEL (Required - Critical for Matching!)
Be HONEST about energy:
- **low**: Spa, massage, meditation, slow walks, reading, gentle stretching
- **medium**: Pottery, painting, badminton, casual cycling, cooking class
- **high**: CrossFit, rock climbing, intense sports, running, dance fitness

‚ùå DON'T say pottery is "low" energy - it requires focus and arm strength (medium)
‚ùå DON'T say walking is "high" energy - it's low

### 4. INDOOR/OUTDOOR (Required)
- indoor: Most classes, gyms, studios, museums
- outdoor: Parks, trails, sports fields, outdoor adventures
- both: Activities that work in either (like yoga, running)

### 5. TAGS (Required - Multiple Dimensions)

**Must include tags for:**

**Experience Level:**
- beginner, intermediate, advanced, mixed

**Mood tags** (what feeling it creates - MOST IMPORTANT for semantic matching):
- creative, relaxed, cozy, mindful, romantic, social, adrenaline, adventurous, explorer, focused

**Context** (who it's for):
- solo, date, friends, family, small-group, group, team

**Equipment:**
- provided, rental-gear, none, camera, laptop, phone

**Requirement:**
- booking-required, booking-optional, lesson-recommended, guide-required

**Cost:**
- $, $$, $$$, $$$$ (or free)

**Terrain** (if outdoor):
- urban, forest, mountain, coast, lake, cave, valley, park, hill

**Time of day:**
- morning, daytime, evening, night, sunset, sunrise, any

## SEMANTIC DESCRIPTION CHECKLIST:

For EACH activity description, include:

‚úÖ **Physical actions** (what you DO with hands/body)
‚úÖ **Emotional outcome** (how you FEEL after)
‚úÖ **Tangible results** (what you GET or make)

‚úÖ **Social dynamics** (solo focus vs group energy)
‚úÖ **Underlying need it fills** (achievement, relaxation, connection, learning)

## REQUEST FORMAT:

When I ask you to generate activities, use this structure:

"Generate 10 [category] activities for [city/region] that appeal to someone who feels [vibe/emotion]. Focus on [specific type] experiences. Include full CSV rows with semantic-rich descriptions."

Example request:
"Generate 10 creative activities for Bucharest that appeal to someone who misses the feeling of building things with their hands (like legos). Focus on hands-on making experiences. Include full CSV rows."

---

## QUALITY CHECKS:

Before submitting, verify EACH activity:

1. ‚úÖ Description reveals UNDERLYING EXPERIENCE (not just "what it is")
2. ‚úÖ Energy level is HONEST (pottery = medium, not low!)
3. ‚úÖ Mood tags match the FEELING it creates
4. ‚úÖ All required tags included (experience_level, mood, context, equipment)
5. ‚úÖ No spaces after commas in tag lists
6. ‚úÖ Duration is realistic (don't say 30 min for a full workshop)
7. ‚úÖ Indoor/outdoor matches reality
8. ‚úÖ Coordinates are accurate

## WHAT MAKES A GREAT ACTIVITY FOR SEMANTIC MATCHING:

‚ùå "Pottery class - learn to make bowls" (surface-level)

‚úÖ "Shape wet clay with your hands through centering, pulling, and trimming techniques. Build a bowl from scratch in a step-by-step process, getting your hands dirty and seeing tangible results of focused work. That proud feeling when you finish something physical."

The second one helps our AI understand it's perfect for someone who says "I miss legos" because it captures:
- Building/creating something
- Step-by-step process
- Hands-on/tactile
- Tangible result
- Sense of accomplishment
