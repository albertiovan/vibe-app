# ✅ FIXED! Run This Now

The filename casing issue is resolved. The file was being ignored by `.gitignore` because it contained "key" in the filename.

## Run This Command:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile standalone
```

This will:
1. ✅ Upload your project (no more casing errors)
2. ✅ Build in the cloud (~15-20 minutes)
3. ✅ Create a standalone .ipa file
4. ✅ App works anywhere (no Mac needed)

## After Build Completes:

```bash
eas build:run --platform ios --latest
```

This installs the app on your iPhone.

## What You'll Get:

- ✅ **Standalone app** (JavaScript bundled inside)
- ✅ **Works anywhere** (no Mac or Metro needed)
- ✅ **All animations** (Reanimated 4.1.5 included)
- ✅ **All features** (516 activities, AI recs, everything)

🚀 **Run the command now!**
