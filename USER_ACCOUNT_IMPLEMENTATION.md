```

**Features:**

### 3. Development Menu (`/components/DevMenu.tsx`)

**Floating Bug Button** 🐛 (Only in `__DEV__` mode)
- Bottom-right corner
- Quick access to dev tools

**Actions Available:**
1. **Clear All User Data** - Deletes account, preferences, and device ID
2. **Show User Info** - Display current user details
3. **Show All Storage Keys** - Debug AsyncStorage

**Usage:**
- Tap bug icon → Opens dev menu
- Select "Clear All User Data"
- Confirm → App resets to onboarding

### 4. App Integration (`App.tsx`)

**New App Flow:**
```
App Launch
  ↓
Check onboarding status
  ↓
  ├─ No account → Show OnboardingScreen
  │     ↓
  │   Complete onboarding → Save data → Show ChatHome
  │
  └─ Has account → Show ChatHome (main app)
```

**Loading States:**
- Initial check shows loading spinner
- Smooth transition to onboarding or main app
- Dev menu available in main app

## User Experience

### First Launch
1. App opens → Loading screen
2. No account detected → Onboarding appears
3. User completes 4 steps
4. Account created → Main app loads
5. All features use this user ID

### After Onboarding
- ChatHomeScreen with personalized greeting
- Challenge Me uses user patterns
- Custom Vibe Profiles saved per user
- Training Mode tracks user feedback
- All data associated with userId

### Development Flow
1. Test app with account
2. Want fresh start?
3. Tap bug icon (bottom-right)
4. "Clear All User Data"
5. Confirm → App resets
6. Onboarding appears again
7. Create new test account

## Integration with Existing Features

### Challenge Me
- Uses `userId` instead of `deviceId`
- Tracks challenges per user
- Learns from user's activity patterns
- Personalized to openness score

### Custom Vibe Profiles
- Profiles saved per `userId`
- Pre-populated based on preferences
- Sorted by usage per user
- Syncs across sessions

### Training Mode
- Feedback tied to `userId`
- Builds user-specific patterns
- Improves recommendations over time
- Analytics per user

### Chat & Conversations
- Uses `userId` for API calls
- Conversation history per user
- Recommendations based on user preferences
- Energy level from onboarding

## API Integration

All backend APIs now use `userId` from account:

```typescript
// Before (using deviceId)
await fetch(`/api/challenges/me?deviceId=${deviceId}`);

// After (using userId)
const userId = await userStorage.getUserId();
await fetch(`/api/challenges/me?userId=${userId}`);
```

**Note:** Current implementation uses `deviceId` for backward compatibility. You can update all API calls to use `userId` for multi-device support.

## Development Workflow

### Testing Onboarding

**Option 1: Dev Menu (Easiest)**
1. Open app
2. Tap bug icon 🐛
3. "Clear All User Data"
4. See onboarding flow

**Option 2: Manual Clear**
```javascript
import { userStorage } from './src/services/userStorage';
await userStorage.clearAllData();
```

**Option 3: Reinstall App**

- Fresh install = new user

### Testing User Patterns
