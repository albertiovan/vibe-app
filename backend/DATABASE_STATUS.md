## 🔄 MCP Integration Status

### **Current Implementation:**
✅ **Direct PostgreSQL queries** - No mock data  
✅ **Real activities from database**  
✅ **Real venues with ratings**  
✅ **Region normalization** (Bucharest → București)  
✅ **Randomized results** for variety  

### **Query Logic:**
```typescript
// Queries real database
const activitiesQuery = `
  SELECT a.id, a.name, a.category, a.city, a.region, a.description
  FROM activities a
  WHERE a.region = $1 OR a.region = 'București'
  ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN a.region = $1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
    RANDOM()
  LIMIT 10
`;

// For each activity, get real venues
const venuesQuery = `
  SELECT v.id, v.name, v.city, v.rating
  FROM venues v
  WHERE v.activity_id = $1
  ORDER BY v.rating DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 3
`;
```

## 📝 Data Quality

### ✅ Verified

## 🧪 Test Query

```sql
-- Verify data
SELECT 
  a.name as activity,
  a.category,
  a.region,
  COUNT(v.id) as venues
FROM activities a
LEFT JOIN venues v ON v.activity_id = a.id
WHERE a.region = 'București'
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, a.category, a.region
ORDER BY venues DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
