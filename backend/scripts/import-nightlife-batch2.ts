    category: 'nightlife',
    description: "A photogenic terrace perched on Lipscani 17, Linea is sunset central‚Äîgolden light, skyline views, and a soundtrack cruising from nu-disco to easy house. Seating clusters around planters and a sleek bar; heaters and canopies stretch the season, but on clear nights the terrace sparkles. The crowd is mixed but style-conscious: couples shooting golden-hour selfies, small groups clinking spritzes, and birthday tables leaning into celebratory energy. It's lively without being chaotic. Cocktails are polished and modern; reservations recommended for prime times. Perfect for a chic pregame that often becomes the main event.",

    category: 'nightlife',
    description: "Mojo is Old Town's three-floor funhouse: a cavernous karaoke stage where strangers become duet partners, a live-band floor smashing rock/pop covers, and a chill pub level for regrouping between sets. Expect colored spotlights, thumping but friendly sound, and a buoyant, mixed crowd‚Äîstudents, office crews, visiting stag parties, and locals who know the staff on a first-name basis. Drinks are straightforward, prices fair, and the energy contagious. It's the kind of place you wander into for 'one song' and leave at 3am with a hoarse voice and ten new videos on your phone.",

    category: 'nightlife',
    description: "Bucharest's legendary jazz caf√© hides behind a leafy garden on Calea Victoriei. Inside, it's all candlelit tables, compact stage, and discreet service; outside, a bohemian terrace hums when the weather's kind. Expect modern jazz trios, singer-songwriters, and theater/alternative events. The room's acoustics flatter warm horns and brushed drums; conversation is possible between sets. Crowd skews artsy and local with visiting jazz heads in the mix. It's a slower, more soulful slice of the city‚Äîperfect for dates or a decompression night after heavy clubbing.",

    category: 'nightlife',
    description: "The city's dedicated stand-up hub sits just off University Square. Inside: a low stage, tight seating, and a room designed for punchlines‚Äîspotlit faces, crisp vocal clarity, and a bar primed for drink refills between sets. Bills mix Romanian comics (often in Romanian) with occasional English-friendly shows; the crowd is students, office crews, and couples on a low-pressure date night. Energy ramps with late shows and weekend specials. If you want a laugh-forward night that still leaves time for post-show drinks nearby, this is your anchor.",

    category: 'social',
    description: "A cozy, neon-lit nest on Bulevardul Dacia where the LGBTQ+ community and allies gather over well-made cocktails and pop/house playlists. The space is intimate‚Äîsoft banquettes, mirrors, low lighting‚Äîand the staff keep the tone welcoming; think flirty eye contact across the room and easy chats at the bar. Weekends can shift from lounge-y to dance-y as the night deepens. It's a safe, stylish spot to warm up before a bigger club night or to settle in for conversation-heavy rounds.",

    description: "A lively LGBTQ+-friendly club near Carol/Universitate that leans into camp and pop: drag shows, throwback divas, and high-gloss dance anthems. The room is intimate but spirited‚Äîtight dance floor, glittering lights, and a crowd that turns up the moment the chorus hits. Expect zero-attitude vibes, lots of sing-alongs, and quick bar service. For a colorful, welcoming night that's heavy on community and light on pretense, Queens is a great call.",
