# Vibes â†’ Experiences: Product Pillars

## Food Policy: Premium Only

### Default Behavior
- **Food is OFF by default**

- No casual dining recommendations

### When Food is Included
Food is only surfaced for **explicit culinary experiences**:

#### Triggers
User must specifically mention:
- "dining", "restaurant", "food", "eating"
- "culinary", "michelin", "tasting menu"
- "fine dining", "chef", "gourmet"

#### Premium Criteria
When food is enabled, only include places that meet ALL:
- **Price Level**: â‰¥3 (Google Places scale 0-4)
- **Rating**: â‰¥4.3 stars
- **Premium Keywords**: michelin, starred, fine dining, tasting, chef
- **OR**: Price Level â‰¥3 AND Rating â‰¥4.5

### Curated Allowlist
Exceptional culinary experiences (Michelin-starred, etc.) bypass normal filters.

## Diversity Algorithm

### Selection Process
1. **Classify** each place into experience sectors
2. **Group** by sector, sort by rating within each
3. **Select** max 2 places per sector (diversity constraint)
4. **Prioritize** sectors by priority score (trails > adrenaline > nature > culture > wellness > nightlife)
5. **Cap** at exactly 5 results
6. **Fallback** to top-rated if insufficient sector diversity

### Diversity Guarantees
- **Minimum 3 sectors** represented when possible
- **Maximum 2 places** per sector
- **Priority-weighted** selection favoring outdoor/active experiences
- **Quality threshold** maintained (rating-based sorting)

## Implementation Rules

### Feature Flags
```typescript
features.experiencesDefault = true  // Default to experiences
features.food = false              // Food off by default
```

### Result Structure
```typescript
{
  places: VibePlace[],     // Exactly 5 diverse results
  totalFound: number,      // Total before diversity filtering
  vibeAnalysis: {
    sectors: string[],     // Sectors represented
    diversity: number      // Diversity score 0-1
  }
}
```

### Quality Assurance
- **No duplicates** (by place_id)
- **Minimum rating** thresholds per sector
- **Distance relevance** (walking time < 60min preferred)
- **Opening hours** awareness when available

## Success Metrics
